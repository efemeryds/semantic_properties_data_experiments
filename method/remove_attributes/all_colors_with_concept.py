Remove as little as possible of the concept word. Manipulate as little as possible.
Remove all colors from the sentence. Keep the modified sentence in the training data.
Remove these words that appear in the proximity of window size (+- 2 words).
Save metadata with info of sentence index, and location of the color and color itself to later input it back.
