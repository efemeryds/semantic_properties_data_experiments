# Semantic properties with corpus data manipulation

The general idea is to experiment with the amount of concept and attribute representation in the raw data that is later used to train word embeddings. With the probing methods one may try to verify how well the concept and the property were learnt in the vector space with regard to the amount of their representation in the corpus.
